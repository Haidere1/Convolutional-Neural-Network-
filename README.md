# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Implementation of CNN to train a model against CIFAR-10 Data set For image classification.
The code contains a simple implementation of Image Classification using CNN, TensorFlow, CIFAR-10 dataset.
The optimizing algorithim being used is ADAM. 
The model is trained for a total of 100 epochs if the percentage of accuracy doesn't change for some epochs 
the alogirithm stops, to save time.
